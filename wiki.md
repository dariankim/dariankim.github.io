This is a current brainstorm of the ideas I have for the final project. Topics that currently interest me are *Machine Learning*, *Astronomy*, and *Satellite Imagery*. Ideas will most likely be eliminated as I understand more about what the course is about and build up tools to make a Web GIS.

## **Section 1: Using remote sensing for mineral identification**
In this idea for the final project I want to classify minerals through satellite imagery. This can be done using *spectroscopy* to measure the light of a region and identify the chemical composition of that region. Through a sorting mechanism whether this is machine learning to learn different regions and their potential classification or manual we can understand the minerals on the surface. Data maybe hard to associate and connect since a lot of preprocessing tools will be needed such as converting the region to a image that can learn spectroscopy measurements and also training the model using CNNs as a way to identify the regions surface minerals which is a trial and error process in terms of constructing the architecture of the model. Another constraint is that satellite imagery is big in terms of scale, so using CNNs can be a challenge since we need our model to be both precise and accurate on a big scale.[^1]
